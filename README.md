## React Concepts Used

This project utilizes several core React features for an optimized experience:

- **`useState`**: Manages state for dynamic elements like cart and wishlist items.
- **`useEffect`**: Handles side effects, such as fetching initial data for gadgets and categories.
- **`useContext`**: Provides a global state for the cart and wishlist, accessible across the entire app.
- **`useRef`**: Tracks specific DOM elements or stores data without triggering re-renders.
- **`useLocation`**: Detects current routes for conditional styling (e.g., changing navbar background on the homepage).
- **`useParams`**: Extracts route parameters, like product ID, to fetch and display specific product details.
- **`useNavigate`**: Provides smooth navigation between pages (e.g., redirecting after completing a purchase).
- **`Link` & `NavLink`**: Enables navigation within the SPA and highlights the active route on the navbar.
- **React State Management**: Centralizes state with Context API for managing cart and wishlist data.
- **`Helmet`**: Adds dynamic titles to each page, enhancing SEO and user experience.

## Data Management

The project uses the **Context API** and **LocalStorage** for efficient data handling:

- **Context API**: The cart and wishlist data are managed centrally via Context API, making it easy to access and modify this data across various components without prop drilling.
- **LocalStorage**: To provide persistence, LocalStorage is used for storing cart and wishlist data, ensuring users' items remain saved across sessions and reloads.
